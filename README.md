# Helpful Scripts Using the Asana Python SDK
Helpful scripts and projects I worked on using the Python SDK for Asana

- [Analyzing Peer Review Data](/Analyzing_Peer_Review_Data.ipynb): An analysis of peer review comments from Asana tasks
- [Asana Task Archival](/asana-task-archival-script.ipynb): A yearly script to move tasks from a project board to another archive project board
- [Tasks with No Due Dates](/no_due_date.py): A script to find all tasks for a project with no due date
- [Added to Project](/added_to_project.py): Adds the date when a task was added to a specific project (requires a custom date field on the project board)
